    I am Zepora, a 2020 gradute of UC Berkeley with Bachelors of Arts in Economics and Molecular and Cell Biology. I am currently an Emergency Medical Technician at NorCal Ambulance, specifically on their PICU (pediatric intensive care unit) dedicated team providing EMTs for the Kaiser Oakland PICU.
    
    <p>
      I played lacrosee on the UC Berkeley Women's Lacrosse team, and try to nurture this habit even in my post-grad era. However I do find myself playing tennis more often, even though lacrosse will always have my heart! As you can probably tell, I love reading, with my favorite genres including fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction.
    </p>

    <p>I also have a slight addiction to video games. My favorite of all time right now is Hollow Knight, but I have more hours clocked in Valorant and Apex Legends. However my heart stays loyal to immersive, single-player RPGs such as Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Assassin's Creed, and Red Dead Redeption 2.</p>

    <p>
      I took a student-led class about coding when COVID cancelled my plans of having a rambunctious senior year (and I therefore overloaded myself with classes), which is what allowed and inspured me to make this website. However, as you can see, I do not possess the skillful intuition to apply all that I learned, but I am trying! I am always working on improving this space and adding content (specifically recipes).

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4931124805">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A phenomenal ending for an invigorating series. I would call it perfect, but that has a connotation that comes across as false. <br /><br />Instead, Neal Shusterman's intricate weaving of and merging of story lines that were seeded from book one come to fruition in an intense cacophony of events. When I mention perfection, it is in the sense that a perfect ending would seem artificial and unrewarding. The perfect ending stemmed from a series of choices by characters and developments that many times left an unpalatable impression, as they were imperfect. However by the end, you turn the final page with a sense of fulfillment and contentment. That is how one achieves the perfect ending.<br /><br />Truly unbelievable series, 10/10!
